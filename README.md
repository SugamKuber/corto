Inspiration:
We stuggled during the last crucial days of our JEE exams as in where to do the revision from? Through this tough experience, we've found a solution for summarising vast syllabus into concise, to the point information for helping students overcome last minute stress and ease them into final prepation, 2-3 days prior to the D-Day.

Learning experience:
We learnt how to do back-end development of a website and used Django and API as our tools. The development of this website wouldn't have been possible, if not for the incredible support and hardwork of each and every team member, thus, this situation made us realise the importance of teamwork and moral values such as unity and integrity. It also gave us an opportunity to brainstorm and put forward our ideas into one beautiful complication, that is the result of this project.

Challenges faced:
We didn't know how to make an infinite scrolling webpage, so it was a new learning for us. Also, in the given time,  proper database couldn't be built by us, we hope to be able to make a more reliant database in future, for better access to the information.
